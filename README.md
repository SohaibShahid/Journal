As part of my new year resolution, I decided to keep a small summary of all my days, just to see the slow change over the course of an entire year. 

Downloading an already-made application would have been easy, but the task i wanted to get done through the application was easy enough that I decided to make my own version of the application. 
And here is the first, very basic, version of said application. 

Features to be added include a daily reminder to log your day and synching the file with google drive so as to keep a backup in case of accidentaly deleting the local version of the file
